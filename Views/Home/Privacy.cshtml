                    Welcome to the IUST Asset Management System. This page outlines our policies regarding the collection, use, and protection of information related to the system's users and data.

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-primary">1. Data Collection</h4>
                <p>
                    We collect non-personal data associated with university infrastructure, including details about campuses, buildings, floors, departments, classrooms, labs, cabins, and facilities. This data is strictly institutional and is used to maintain operational efficiency.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-primary">2. Use of Data</h4>
                <p>
                    The data is used for the sole purpose of managing assets, planning infrastructure, and enhancing the utility of spaces within the university. We do not share this data with third parties.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-primary">3. User Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>
                    Users accessing or updating data must ensure its accuracy and integrity. Any misuse or unauthorized alteration of data may result in restricted access or further administrative action.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-primary">4. Data Security</h4>
                <p>
                    All data operations are conducted over secure connections. Access to the system is role-based and managed by university administration to ensure protection against unauthorized use.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-4 text-primary">5. External Links</h4>
